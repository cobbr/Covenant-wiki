I plan to actively develop and continue to enhance Covenant. I have plans for lots of things I’d like to add or enhance. I’ll list below some of the things I’d like to add in the short-term, so people know what to expect (and hopefully spark ideas for outside contributions :)):

* Bug Squashing - As a warning, Covenant is a brand new project. I fully expect users to break it and discover all sorts of bugs. I imagine I will primarily be squashing bugs in the short-term.
* Credential Tracking - Users are likely accustomed to these sorts of tools tracking credentials that are obtained throughout an operation. I would like to integrate a similar feature into Covenant.
* Keylogging Utility - Covenant allows for users to use their own keylogging assemblies in memory as a task, but I think it’d be useful for Covenant to implement a built-in keylogger.
Screenshot Utility - Similar to a keylogging utility, Covenant allows for users to use their own screenshot assemblies in memory as a task, but I think it’d be useful for Covenant to implement a built-in screenshot utility.
* Enhanced Indicator Tracking - As alluded to earlier in the post, indicator tracking is a feature I would like to further enhance. Specifically, I’d like to add many more types of indicators that are tracked, and eventually would like to track them based on specific tasks conducted on Grunt implants.
* Improved User Roles - Covenant implements a user and role structure that I think can be enhanced. I’d like to allow for the idea of administrative users, read-only users, etc. Eventually users could be assigned with specific privileges for specific listeners or Grunt implants.

I have some long-term goals and enhancements I’d like to make as well, but those are the enhancements you’re likely to see in the short-term.

Additionally, I plan to write several follow-up blog posts on Covenant usage that I have not gone into depth on here. I’ve kept this post high-level enough to introduce Covenant and the basics of how to use it, but look for more detailed information and advanced usage in the near future.
