## C2Bridges

C2Bridges are used to develop an outbound command and control protocol without editing any Covenant code. For developers that feel comfortable integrating new listeners, a new C2 protocol should be added as a first-class new listener type that is fully integrated into the interface. However, it may be faster in some situations to create a C2Bridge outside of Covenant and connect it with a `BridgeListener` for proof-of-concepts or testing out new protocols.

Developers can use the [C2Bridge](https://github.com/cobbr/C2Bridge) project as a template for creating new C2Bridges. Within the C2Bridge project, there is an abstract `C2Bridge` class. A developer can inherit from this class and implement the needed functions to read and write from implants to the BridgeListener using the new chosen C2 protocol.

    }

        }

        {

            if (parsed != null)
            {
                _ = this.BridgeConnector.Write(this.BridgeProfile.FormatRead(parsed));
                return parsed.Guid;

        protected abstract string GetBridgeMessengerCode();

```

The C2Bridge project contains an example `TCPC2Bridge` class that inherits from this interface and provides an example of how to implement one.

![TCPC2Bridge](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/images/covenant-tcpc2bridge.png)

Once you have written your new C2Bridge, the constructor call for `TCPC2Bridge` within the `Main()` function can be replaced with the new constructor:

![C2Bridge Constructor](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/images/covenant-c2bridgeconstructor.png)

The abstract `GetBridgeMessengerCode()` method is not actually used anywhere within the C2Bridge project but is used to tie together a C2Bridge with an implant. An implant needs code that is able to read and write to the outbound C2Bridge. This code is specific to a given C2Bridge, and should be placed within the inherited `GetBridgeMessengerCode()` method. A Covenant user that utilizes a C2Bridge will take the `BridgeMessengerCode` from this method and use it within a `BridgeProfile`.

### BridgeProfile

Covenant users that utilize a C2Bridge will need to configure a `BridgeProfile` that is specific to the C2Bridge. The Grunt implants need to know how to read and write to the outbound C2Bridge. The `BridgeProfile.BridgeMessengerCode` property represents the code that will be placed in the implant and is responsible for reading and writing to the outbound C2Bridge. This code should be found in a C2Bridge's `GetBridgeMessengerCode()` method.

Users can create an entirely new `BridgeProfile` or edit the `DefaultBridgeProfile` with the correct `BridgeMessengerCode`. To do so, you'll navigate to the listeners navigation page and select the "Profiles" tab:

![Profiles Table](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/images/covenant-gui-profiles.png)

To create a new profile, click on the "Create" button. To edit a particular profile, click on the name of the profile. Keep in mind, that you cannot edit profiles that are associated with active listeners.

After clicking "Create", select the "BridgeProfile" tab:

![Create BridgeProfile](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/images/covenant-gui-bridgeprofilecreate.png)

The following options will need to be configured when editing or creating a profile:

* **Name** - The `Name` of the profile that will be used throughout the interface. Pick something recognizable!
* **Description** - The `Description` of the profile. This should be a thorough description of the profile that operators can read and easily understand how the profile works, and the use cases for which it would be appropriate to use the profile. 
* **MessageTransform** - The `MessageTransform` is a unique way to specify how the communication data will be transformed before being placed into the formats specified in the `ReadFormat` and `WriteFormat`. An `MessageTransform` should be a static C# class named `MessageTransform` that includes a public `Transform` and a public `Invert` function. The class can transform the data in any way that you desire, as long as the Transform and Invert functions mirror each other (i.e. `data == MessageTransform.Invert(MessageTransform.Transform(data))`). The `MessageTransform` class must be cross-platform compatible and compile under `Net40`, `Net35`, and `NetCore21`.
* **ReadFormat** - The `ReadFormat` is the format of a message when a Grunt reads data from a C2Bridge. The format must include a location for the data and Grunt GUID to be placed. Include the string "{DATA}" to indicate the location that the data should be placed and the string "{GUID}" to indicate the location that the GUID should be placed.
* **WriteFormat** - The `WriteFormat` is the format of a message when a Grunt writes data to a C2Bridge. The format must include a location for the data and Grunt GUID to be placed. Include the string "{DATA}" to indicate the location that the data should be placed and the string "{GUID}" to indicate the location that the GUID should be placed.
* **BridgeMessengerCode** - The `BridgeMessengerCode` is the code that will be placed in the implant and is responsible for reading and writing to the outbound C2Bridge. This code should be found in a C2Bridge's `GetBridgeMessengerCode()` method.

When configuring these options, the Covenant user has total freedom to configure any of these values any way they would like, except for the `BridgeMessengerCode` property. The `BridgeMessengerCode` propery must be taken from the C2Bridge.

If a Covenant user does edit the `ReadFormat` and/or `WriteFormat` properties, the C2Bridge must be informed of this change when starting the C2Bridge. The [C2Bridge](https://github.com/cobbr/C2Bridge) project accepts a `--profile <profile.yaml>` parameter that accepts a profile YAML file, which can optionally be used when these properties are customized.

### Summary

The overall process for developing and utilizing a C2Bridge is as follows:

1. Write the "listener" code for reading and writing on a custom command and control protocol to an implant.
2. Write the implant code for reading and writing on a custom command and control protocol to a "listener".
3. Implement a C2Bridge using the "listener" and implant code that inherits from the abstract `C2Bridge` class from the [C2Bridge](https://github.com/cobbr/C2Bridge) project. Reference the `TCPC2Bridge` class as an example.
4. Within Covenant, create a `BridgeProfile` that uses the `BridgeMessengerCode` found in the C2Bridge's `GetBridgeMessengerCode()` method.
5. Start a [BridgeListener](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/Bridge-Listeners) that uses the created `BridgeProfile`.
6. Start the C2Bridge that connects to the BridgeListener. If you customized the BridgeProfile's `ReadFormat` and/or `WriteFormat` properties, use the optional `--profile <profile.yaml>` CLI parameter to inform the C2Bridge of these customizations.
7. Generate launchers that utilize the `GruntBridge` ImplantTemplate and the BridgeListener you started.
8. Test out your new launcher that utilizes a custom command and control protocol!
